== Managing Policies

As mentioned earlier, policies define the conditions that must be satisfied before granting access to an object.

You can view all policies associated with a resource server by clicking on the *Policy* tab when editing a resource server.

On this tab, you'll find the list of policies as well as options to create and edit a policy.

To create a new policy, select a policy type in the dropdown `Create policy` located in the right upper corner of the policy listing. Details about each policy type are described in this section.
