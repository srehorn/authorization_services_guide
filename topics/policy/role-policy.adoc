== Role-Based Policy

This type of policy allows you to define conditions for your permissions where only a set of one or more roles is allowed
to access an object.

By default, roles added to this policy are not marked as required and the policy will grant access if the user asking for access has any of these roles. However, {{book.project.name}} also allows you
to mark a specific role as link:role-policy-required-role.adoc[required] in case you want to enforce the presence of a role. You can even mix required and non-required roles, regardless of whether they are realm
or client roles.

Role policies can be very useful when you need a more restricted role-based access control (RBAC), where specific roles must be present in order to grant access to an object. For instance,
you may enforce that a user must consent to letting a client application (which is acting on his behalf) access his resources. Here you can benefit from {{book.project.name}} Client Scope Mapping to
enable consent pages or even enforce clients to explicitly provide a scope when obtaining access tokens from a {{book.project.name}} server.

To create a new role-based policy, select the option *Role-Based* in the dropdown located in the right upper corner of the permission listing.
