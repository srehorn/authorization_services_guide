== Defining a Role as Required

When creating a role-based policy, you may mark a specific role as `Required`. When you do that, the policy will grant access
only if the user asking for access is granted with *all* the *required* roles. Both realm and client roles can be configured as such.

To mark a role as required, mark the `Required` checkbox on the role you want to configure as required.

Required roles can be very handy when your policy defines multiple roles but only a subset of them are mandatory. In this case, you can mix realm and client roles to enable an
even more fine-grained RBAC model for your application. For instance, you may have policies specific for a client and require a specific client role associated with that client. Or you can just
enforce that access is granted only in the presence of a specific realm role. Or even have both approaches within the same policy.
