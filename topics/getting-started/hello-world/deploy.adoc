== Build, Deploy and Test

Now that the *hello-world-authz-service* is properly configured and authorization services are enabled, we can deploy it to
the server and see the results.

=== Generating the Adapter Configuration

First, let's obtain the adapter configuration from the {{book.project.name}} Administration Console. Click on the `Clients` left menu item. In the client listing,
click on the *hello-world-authz-service* client application. This will bring you the `Client Details` page.

.Client Details

Click on the `Installation Tab`. From the `Format Option` dropdown, select `Keycloak OIDC JSON`. This will display the adapter configuration in JSON format. Copy the contents to the clipboard and create a file or use the Download button.

Now, go to the *${KEYCLOAK_DEMO_SERVER_DIR}/examples/authz/hello-world-authz-service/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF*. There you'll find a *keycloak.json* file. Replace its contents with the adapter configuration
you just obtained from the {{book.project.name}} Administration Console.

By default, the policy enforcer responds with a `403` status code when the user lacks permissions to access protected resources on the resource server. However, you can also provide a redirection URL for unauthorized users. To customize this, change the *keycloak.json* file you just updated and replace the `policy-enforcer` configuration with the following:

```json
"policy-enforcer": {
    "on-deny-redirect-to" : "/hello-world-authz-service/error.jsp"
  }
```

That last configuration tells the policy enforcer to redirect users to a `/hello-world-authz-service/error.jsp` page if they don't have the necessary permissions to access a protected resource, rather than an unhelpful `403 Unauthrorized` message.

=== Build and Deploy the Application

Lastly, go to the *${KEYCLOAK_DEMO_SERVER_DIR}/examples/authz/hello-world-authz-service/* and execute the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
```

=== Test the Application

If your application was successfully deployed you should be able to access it at http://localhost:8080/hello-world-authz-service[http://localhost:8080/hello-world-authz-service].

The first page you should see is the {{book.project.name}} Login Page.

.Login Page

Try to login as *alice* using the password you set up that user. After authenticating, you should see a page as follows:

.Hello World Authz Main Page
image:../../../images/getting-started/hello-world/main-page.png[alt="Hello World Authz Main Page"]

The link:../../resource-server/default-config.html[Default Settings] defined by {{book.project.name}} when you enable authorization services for a client application provide a simple
policy that grants access only to users belonging to the realm where the client is defined.

You can start playing around by changing the default permissions and policies and check how your application will behave, or even create new policies using the different
link:../../policy/overview.html[Policy Types] provided by {{book.project.name}}.

There are a plenty of things you can do now to test this application. For instance, you can change the default policy by clicking on the `Authorization` tab for the client, then `Policies` tab, then click on `Default Policy` in the list to allow you to change it as follows:

```js
// The default value is $evaluation.grant(), 
// let's see what happens when we change it to $evaluation.deny()
$evaluation.deny();

```

Now, logout from the demo application and log in again. You should no longer be able to access the application.

Let's fix that now, but instead of changing the `Default Policy` code we are just going to change the `Logic` to `Negative` using the dropdown control below the policy code text area. That should re-enable access to the application
as we are just negating the result of that policy, which is by default denying all requests for access. Again, before testing this change, be sure to logout and log in again.

=== Next Steps

There are a lot of other things you can do from now on, such as:

* Create a scope, define a policy and permission for it and check on the application side if the user is allowed to perform some action (or anything else represented by the scope you created)
* Create different types of policies such as link:../../policy/role-policy.adoc[Role-Based], link:../../policy/user-policy.adoc[User-Based], link:../../policy/time-policy.adoc[Time-Based], link:../../policy/aggregated-policy.adoc[Aggregated Policies], link:../../policy/drools-policy.adoc[Drools-Based]. And associate these policies with the `Default Permission`
* Apply multiple policies to the `Default Permission` and check behavior. For instance, try to mix multiple policies and change the `Decision Strategy` accordingly
* Checkout the link:../../enforcer/authorization-context.adoc[Obtaining the Authorization Context] topic for more details about how to check for permissions inside your application
