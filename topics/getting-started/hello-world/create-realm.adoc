== Creating a Realm

The first step is to create a realm. The realm we are about to create is very simple and consists of:

* A single user

* A single client application, which we're going to turn into a link:../../overview/terminology.html[Resource Server] and enable
the authorization services

Create a realm with a name *hello-world-authz*. Once created, you should see a page similar to the following:

.Realm hello-world-authz

Next, create a single user in your newly-created realm. Click on the `Users` left menu item. This will bring you
to the user list page. On the right side of the empty user list, you should see an `Add User` button. Click that to start creating the new user with the username of *alice*.

Fill in the fields as shown below and click `Save`.

Next, set a password for the *alice* user by clicking on the `Credentials` tab to display the `Credentials` page.

.Set User Password

Fill in the `New Password` and `Password Confirmation` fields with a password and click  the `Temporary` switch to turn it `OFF`. Lastly,
click on the `Reset Password` button to set the user's password.
