=== Viewing Resources

When you click on *Resource* tab, you'll see a page that lists the resources associated with a resource server.

.Resources

The resource list provides some very useful information about the protected resources, such as:

* Type
* URI
* Owner
* Associated scopes, if any
* Associated permissions

From this list, you can also directly create a permission by clicking on the `Create Permission` button for the resource you want to create the permission.

[NOTE]
Before creating permissions to your resources, make sure you have already defined the policies you want to associate with the permission.
