== Protecting a Stateless Service Using a Bearer Token

If the adapter is configured with the `bearer-only` configuration option, the policy enforcer will decide whether a request
is allowed to access a protected resource or not based on the permissions carried along with a bearer token.

. HTTP GET example passing a RPT as a bearer token
```bash
GET /my-resource-server/my-protected-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: host.com
Authorization: Bearer ${RPT}
...
```

In this example, you would have a *keycloak.json* file in your application similar to the following:

.Example of WEB-INF/keycloak.json with the bearer-only configuration option
```json
...
"bearer-only" : true,
...
```

=== Authorization Response

When a client tries to access a resource server with a bearer token that is lacking permissions to access a protected resource, the resource server
will respond with a *401* status code and a `WWW-Authenticate` header. The value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header depends on the authorization protocol
in use by the resource server.

Here is an example of a response from a resource server which is using UMA as the authorization protocol:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: UMA realm="photoz-restful-api",as_uri="http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/photoz/authz/authorize",ticket="${PERMISSION_TICKET}"
```

And another example when the resource server is using the Entitlement protocol:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: KC_ETT realm="photoz-restful-api",as_uri="http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/photoz/authz/entitlement"
```

Once a client receives a response from the server, it should check the status code and `WWW-Authenticate` header in order to obtain
a RPT from a {{book.project.name}} Server.
