== Policy Enforcers

Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is a design pattern and as such you can implement it in different ways. {{book.project.name}} provides all the necessary means
to implement PEPs for different platforms, environments, and even different programming languages. {{book.project.name}} {{book.project.module}} presents a 
 RESTful API, and leverages OAuth2 authorization capabilities for fine-grained authorization using a centralized authorization server.
