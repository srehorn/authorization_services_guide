== JavaScript Integration

The {{book.project.name}} Server comes with a JavaScript library you can use to interact with a resource server protected by a policy enforcer. This library is based on the https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/securing-client-applications-guide/content/topics/oidc/javascript-adapter.html[Keycloak JavaScript Adapter], which means your client
should be using it to authenticate against a {{book.project.name}} Server.

You can obtain this library from a running {{book.project.name}} Server instance by including the following `script` tag in your web page:

```html
<script src="http://${KEYCLOAK_HOST}/auth/js/keycloak-authz.js"></script>
```
Once you do that, you can create a `KeycloakAuthorization` instance as follows:

```javascript
var keycloak = // obtain a Keycloak instance from keycloak.js library
var authorization = new KeycloakAuthorization(keycloak);
```
The *keycloak-authz.js* library provides two main functionalities:

* Handle responses from a resource server protected by a link:overview.html[{{book.project.name}} Policy Enforcer] and obtain a RPT with the necessary permissions to gain access to
the protected resources on the resource server

** In this case, the library can handle whatever authorization protocol the resource server is using: link:../service/authorization/authorization-api.html[UMA] or link:../service/entitlement/entitlement-api.html[Entitlements].

* Obtain permissions from a {{book.project.name}} Server using the link:../service/entitlement/entitlement-api.html[Entitlement API]

In both cases, the library allows you to easily interact with both resource server and {{book.project.name}} {{book.project.module}} in order to obtain tokens with the
necessary permissions that your client can use as bearer tokens to access the protected resources on a resource server.

=== Handling Authorization Responses from a Resource Server

If a resource server is protected by a policy enforcer, it will respond to client requests based on the permissions carried along with a link:keycloak-enforcement-bearer.html[bearer token].
Usually, when you try to access a resource server with a bearer token that is lacking permissions to access a protected resource, the resource server
will respond with a *401* status code and a `WWW-Authenticate` header.

The value of the `WWW-Authenticate` header depends on the authorization protocol in use by the resource server. Whatever protocol is in use, you can use a `KeycloakAuthorization` instance to
handle responses as follows:

```javascript
var wwwAuthenticateHeader = // extract WWW-Authenticate Header from the response in case of a 401 status code
authorization.authorize(wwwAuthenticateHeader).then(function (rpt) {
    // onGrant callback function. If authorization was successful you'll receive a RPT with the necessary permissions to access the resource server
}, function () {
    // onDeny callback function. Called when the authorization request is denied by the server
}, function () {
    // onError callback function. Called when the server responds unexpectedly
});
```

The `authorize` function is completely asynchronous and supports a few callback functions in order to receive notifications from the server:

* `onGrant`, is the first argument of the function. If authorization was successful and the server returned a RPT with the requested permissions, the callback will receive the RPT
* `onDeny`, is the second argument of the function. Only called if the server has denied the authorization request
* `onError`, is the third argument of the function. Only called if the server responds unexpectedly

Most applications would use the `onGrant` callback to retry a request after a 401 response. Where subsequent requests should include the RPT as a bearer token.

=== Obtaining Entitlements

The keycloak-authz.js provides a `entitlement` function that you can use to obtain a RPT from the server using the Entitlement API.

```json
authorization.entitlement('my-resource-server-id').then(function (rpt) {
    // onGrant callback function. If authorization was successful you'll receive a RPT with the necessary permissions to access the resource server
});
```
When using the `entitlement` function, you just need to provide the _client_id_ of the resource server you want to access.

The `entitlement` function is completely asynchronous and supports a few callback functions in order to receive notifications from the server:

* `onGrant`, is the first argument of the function. If authorization was successful and the server returned a RPT with the requested permissions, the callback will receive the RPT
* `onDeny`, is the second argument of the function. Only called if the server has denied the authorization request
* `onError`, is the third argument of the function. Only called if the server responds unexpectedly

=== Obtaining the RPT

If you have already obtained a RPT using any of the authorization functions provided by the library, you can always obtain the RPT as follows:

```javascript
var rpt = authorization.rpt;
```
