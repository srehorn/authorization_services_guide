== What is a PAT and How to Obtain It?

A *Protection API Token* (PAT) is a special OAuth2 Access Token with a scope defined as  *uma_protection*. When you create a resource server, {{book.project.name}} automatically
creates a role _uma_protection_ for the corresponding client application and associates it with the client's service account.

Resource servers can obtain a PAT from {{book.project.name}} just like any other OAuth2 Access Token. For example, using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Basic aGVsbG8td29ybGQtYXV0aHotc2VydmljZTpwYXNzd29yZA==" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
    "http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/${realm_name}/protocol/openid-connect/token"
```

The example above is using the *client_credentials* grant type to obtain a PAT from the server. As a result, the server would return a response similar to the following:

[NOTE]
{{book.project.name}} can authenticate your client application in different ways. We are using *client_credentials* grant type for the sake of simplicity, which basically requires a _client_id_ and a _client_secret_. You can choose any other supported authentication method.

```bash
{
  "access_token": ${PAT},
  "expires_in": 300,
  "refresh_expires_in": 1800,
  "refresh_token": ${refresh_token},
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "id_token": ${id_token},
  "not-before-policy": 0,
  "session_state": "ccea4a55-9aec-4024-b11c-44f6f168439e"
}
```
