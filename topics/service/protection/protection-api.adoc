== Protection API

The Protection API provides a UMA-compliant set of endpoints providing:

* *Resource Registration*
+
With this endpoint, resource servers can manage their resources remotely and enable link::../../../../enforcer/overview.adoc[Policy Enforcers] to query the server for the resources that need protection.

* *Permission Registration*
+
In the UMA protocol, resource servers access this endpoint which issues permission tickets.

An important requirement for this API is that _only_ resource servers are allowed to access its endpoints using a special OAuth2 access token called *Protection API Token* or *PAT*.
In UMA, a PAT is just a token with a scope *uma_protection*.
