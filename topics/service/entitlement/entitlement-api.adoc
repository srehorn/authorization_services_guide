== Entitlements API

The *Entitlement API* provides a 1-legged protocol for obtaining authorization data from the server, where the authorization data
represents the result of the evaluation of all permissions and authorization policies associated with the resources being requested.

Unlike the _Authorization API_, the Entitlement API is not UMA-compliant and doesn't require permission tickets.

The purpose of this API is provide a more lightweight API for obtaining authorization data, where the client in possession of a valid
OAuth2 Access Token is able to obtain the necessary authorization data on behalf of its users.
