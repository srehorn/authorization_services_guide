Finally, click `Save`. When the save is complete,
a new `Authorization` tab will show up in the tab set for this client. Click on this tab and you should see a page similar to the following:

.Resource Server Settings

The `Authorization` tab provides a few additional tabs covering the different steps that you should follow to actually protect your application's resources. Each tab is covered separately by
a specific topic in this documentation. But here is a quick description about each one:

* *Settings*
+
General settings for your resource server. More details about this page in this section.

* *Resource*
+
From this tab, you can manage your application's link:../resource/overview.html[Resources].

* *Scope*
+
From this tab, you can manage link:../resource/overview.html[Scopes].

* *Policies*
+
From this tab, you can manage link:../policy/overview.html[Authorization Policies] and define the conditions that must be met in order to grant a permission.

* *Permissions*
+
From this tab, you can manage the link:../permission/overview.html[Permissions] for your protected resources and scopes by linking them with the policies you created.

* *Evaluate*
+
From this tab, you can link:../policy-evaluation-tool/overview.html[Simulate Authorization Requests] and check the result of the evaluation of the permissions and authorization policies you have defined.

=== Resource Server Settings

Letâ€™s walk through each configuration item on this page.

* *Policy Enforcement Mode*
+
Dictates how policies are enforced when processing authorization requests sent to the server.
+
** *Enforcing*
+
This is the default mode. Requests are denied by default even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
+
** *Permissive*
+
Requests are allowed even when there is no policy associated with a given resource.
** *Disabled*
+
Completely disables the evaluation of policies and allows access to any resource.
+
* *Allow Remote Resource Management*
+
Should resources be managed remotely by the resource server? If false, resources can  be managed only from this admin console.  

+
* *Export Settings*
+
In this section you can export the authorization configuration settings to a JSON file. Click the `Export` button to display the complete JSON configuration for you to download. The configuration contains everything defined for a resource server:  protected resources, scopes, permissions and policies.
